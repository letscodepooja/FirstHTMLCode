# FirstHTMLCode
Introduction
This is my first HTML code, a simple webpage that serves as an introduction to opening and closing tags and attributes in HTML. This code is intended to provide a basic understanding of the fundamental building blocks of HTML.

This contains the code for the webpage.
HTML Tags
Opening and Closing Tags
HTML documents are built using various elements, each represented by a specific tag. A tag is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets that tells the browser how to interpret and display the content. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.

Opening Tag: It marks the beginning of an HTML element and is denoted by the tag name within angle brackets, like <tagname>.
Closing Tag: It marks the end of an HTML element and is similar to the opening tag but with a forward slash before the tag name, like </tagname>.
For example, to create a paragraph, you use the <p> tag for the opening and </p> tag for the closing:

html
Copy code
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
Attributes
HTML tags can also have attributes, which provide additional information about an element. Attributes are added within the opening tag and are composed of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign.

For example, the <a> tag represents a hyperlink and has an attribute called href, which specifies the URL the link points to:

html
Copy code
<a href="https://www.youtube.com">Visit Example</a>
In this example, href is the attribute name, and "https://www.youtube.com" is the attribute value.

Conclusion
This simple HTML code introduces you to the concept of opening and closing tags and attributes. Understanding these foundational concepts will help you build more complex and interactive webpages in the future. Have fun exploring the world of web development!
